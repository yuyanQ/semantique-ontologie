==[[Chapter 3: What are OWL Ontologies?]] ==

[[examenSujet::Ontologies]] are used to capture knowledge about some domain of interest. An ontology describes the concepts in the domain and also the relationships that hold between those concepts. Different ontology languages provide different facilities. The most recent development in standard ontology languages is OWL from the [[organisation::World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)]]. Like Protégé, OWL makes it possible to describe concepts but it also provides new facilities. It has a richer set of operators - e.g. intersection, union and negation. It is based on a different logical model which makes it possible for concepts to be defined as well as described. Complex concepts can therefore be built up in definitions out of simpler concepts. Furthermore, the logical model allows the use of a reasoner which can check whether or not all of the statements and definitions in the ontology are mutually consistent and can also recognise which concepts fit under which definitions. The [[avantage::reasoner]] can therefore help to maintain the hierarchy correctly. This is particularly useful when dealing with cases where classes can have more than one parent.
===3.1 Components of OWL Ontologies===
OWL ontologies have similar components to [[logiciel::Protégé]] frame based ontologies. However, the terminology used to describe these components is slightly different from that used in Protégé. An OWL ontology consists of [[composants::Individuals]], [[composants::Properties]], and [[composants::Classes]], which roughly correspond to Protégé frames Instances,
Slots and Classes.
====3.1.1 Individuals====
Individuals, represent objects in the domain in which we are interested 2. An important difference between Protégé and OWL is that OWL does not use the Unique Name Assumption (UNA). This means that two different names could actually refer to the same individual. For example, “Queen Elizabeth”, “The Queen” and “Elizabeth Windsor” might all refer to the same individual. In OWL, it must be explicitly stated that individuals are the same as each other, or different to each other — otherwise they might be the same as each other, or they might be different to each other. Figure 3.1 shows a representation of some individuals in some domain—in this tutorial we represent individuals as diamonds in diagrams.
====3.1.2 Properties====

====3.1.3 Classes====
OWL classes are interpreted as sets that contain individuals. They are described using formal (math- ematical) descriptions that state precisely the requirements for membership of the class. For example, the class Cat would contain all the individuals that are cats in our domain of interest.5 Classes may be organised into a superclass-subclass hierarchy, which is also known as a taxonomy. Subclasses specialise (‘are subsumed by’) their superclasses. For example consider the classes Animal and Cat – Cat might be a subclass of Animal (so Animal is the superclass of Cat). This says that, ‘All cats are animals’, ‘All members of the class Cat are members of the class Animal’, ‘Being a Cat implies that you’re an Animal’, and ‘Cat is subsumed by Animal’. One of the key features of OWL-DL is that these superclass-subclass relationships (subsumption relationships) can be computed automatically by a reasoner – more on this later. Figure 3.3 shows a representation of some classes containing individuals – classes are represented as circles or ovals, rather like sets in Venn diagrams.
